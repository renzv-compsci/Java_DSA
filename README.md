## 📖 About This Repo

This repository is a personal learning space for:
- 💪 Strengthening my DSA skills in Java
- 🎯 Preparing for technical interviews and CS classes
- 🏗️ Building a solid foundation in classic and advanced DSA topics
- 📝 Documenting my progress with code, notes, and projects

> **Note:**  
> 🆕 This is a newly created and actively growing repository!  
> Many of the topics listed below are not yet present in the codebase.  
> The roadmap serves as a personal learning guide—topics will be added and implemented sequentially as I progress.
